Overview
========
`Plano <https://github.com/katanemo/plano>`_ is delivery infrastructure for agentic apps. A models-native proxy server and data plane designed to help you build agents faster, and deliver them reliably to production.

Plano pulls out the rote plumbing work (the “hidden AI middleware”) and decouples you from brittle, ever‑changing framework abstractions. It centralizes what shouldn’t be bespoke in every codebase like agent routing and orchestration, rich agentic signals and traces for continuous improvement, guardrail filters for safety and moderation, and smart LLM routing APIs for UX and DX agility. Use any language or AI framework, and ship agents to production faster with Plano.

Built by core contributors to the widely adopted `Envoy Proxy <https://www.envoyproxy.io/>`_, Plano gives you a production‑grade foundation for agentic applications. It helps **developers** stay focused on the core logic of their agents, helps **product teams** shorten feedback loops for learning, and helps **engineering teams**  standardize policy and safety across agents and LLMs. Plano is grounded in open protocols (de facto: OpenAI‑style v1/responses, de jure: MCP) and proven patterns like sidecar deployments, so it plugs in cleanly while remaining robust, scalable, and flexible.

In this documentation, you’ll learn how to set up Plano quickly, trigger API calls via prompts, apply guardrails without tight coupling with application code, simplify model and provider integration, and improve observability — so that you can focus on what matters most: the core product logic of your agents.
