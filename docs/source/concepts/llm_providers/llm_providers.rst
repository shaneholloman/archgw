Model (LLM) Providers
=====================
**Model Providers** are a top-level primitive in Plano, helping developers centrally define, secure, observe,
and manage the usage of their models. Plano builds on Envoy's reliable `cluster subsystem <https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.31.2/intro/arch_overview/upstream/cluster_manager>`_ to manage egress traffic to models, which includes intelligent routing, retry and fail-over mechanisms,
ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. This abstraction also enables developers to seamlessly switch between model providers or upgrade model versions, simplifying the integration and scaling of models across applications.

Today, we are enable you to connect to 15+ different AI providers through a unified interface with advanced routing and management capabilities.
Whether you're using OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, local Ollama models, or any OpenAI-compatible provider, Plano provides seamless integration with enterprise-grade features.

.. note::
    Please refer to the quickstart guide :ref:`here <llm_routing_quickstart>` to configure and use LLM providers via common client libraries like OpenAI and Anthropic Python SDKs, or via direct HTTP/cURL requests.

Core Capabilities
-----------------

**Multi-Provider Support**
Connect to any combination of providers simultaneously (see :ref:`supported_providers` for full details):

- First-Class Providers: Native integrations with OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Mistral, Groq, Google Gemini, Together AI, xAI, Azure OpenAI, and Ollama
- OpenAI-Compatible Providers: Any provider implementing the OpenAI Chat Completions API standard

**Intelligent Routing**
Three powerful routing approaches to optimize model selection:

- Model-based Routing: Direct routing to specific models using provider/model names (see :ref:`supported_providers`)
- Alias-based Routing: Semantic routing using custom aliases (see :ref:`model_aliases`)
- Preference-aligned Routing: Intelligent routing using the Plano-Router model (see :ref:`preference_aligned_routing`)

**Unified Client Interface**
Use your preferred client library without changing existing code (see :ref:`client_libraries` for details):

- OpenAI Python SDK: Full compatibility with all providers
- Anthropic Python SDK: Native support with cross-provider capabilities
- cURL & HTTP Clients: Direct REST API access for any programming language
- Custom Integrations: Standard HTTP interfaces for seamless integration

Key Benefits
------------

- **Provider Flexibility**: Switch between providers without changing client code
- **Three Routing Methods**: Choose from model-based, alias-based, or preference-aligned routing (using `Plano-Router-1.5B <https://huggingface.co/katanemo/Plano-Router-1.5B>`_) strategies
- **Cost Optimization**: Route requests to cost-effective models based on complexity
- **Performance Optimization**: Use fast models for simple tasks, powerful models for complex reasoning
- **Environment Management**: Configure different models for different environments
- **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new providers and upgrade models

Common Use Cases
----------------

**Development Teams**
- Use aliases like ``dev.chat.v1`` and ``prod.chat.v1`` for environment-specific models
- Route simple queries to fast/cheap models, complex tasks to powerful models
- Test new models safely using canary deployments (coming soon)

**Production Applications**
- Implement fallback strategies across multiple providers for reliability
- Use intelligent routing to optimize cost and performance automatically
- Monitor usage patterns and model performance across providers

**Enterprise Deployments**
- Connect to both cloud providers and on-premises models (Ollama, custom deployments)
- Apply consistent security and governance policies across all providers
- Scale across regions using different provider endpoints
